Rudimentary Python stub files for dependencies used in my personal and
professional projects. While I try to precise, these stubs usually only
contain the functions, classes, and methods I need. Use them as the basis
of your own stubs by copying the stubs directory into your project and
modifying the stubs for your needs or using this repository as a git
submodule. I gladly accept pull requests.

Improved versions of these stubs should eventually be added to
[typeshed](https://github.com/python/typeshed).

## Usage

```
git submodule add git@github.com:srittau/python-stubs.git
```
